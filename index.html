<section><h4>I'm a storyteller with a knack for voice and branding, impassioned by culture, travel, and global connectivity. Published by National Geographic at the age of 21, and following a stint in the world of editing and publishing, I'm ready to at last make my mark in the startup sector.</h4></section>

<h4>After all, companies tell stories too. Solid marketing relies heavily on a strong corporate narrative. In this era of multifaceted media, compelling branding is in fact storytelling. I learned this firsthand while spearheading comprehensive campaigns for a leading Los Angeles publication. Now I jump at the chance to work for a focused startup intent on changing, well, the world. Is this the part where I say "pick me?"</h4>

<h4>Let's get the job done.</h4>
