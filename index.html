<h1>Alex Markoff</h1>





	<h3>I'm a <strong>storyteller</strong> with a knack for <strong>voice</strong> and <strong>branding</strong>, impassioned by culture, travel, and global connectivity. Published by National Geographic at the age of 21, and following a stint in the world of editing and publishing, I'm ready to at last make my mark in the startup sector.

	After all, companies tell stories too. Solid marketing relies heavily on a strong corporate narrative. In this era of multifaceted media, compelling branding is in fact storytelling. I learned this firsthand while spearheading comprehensive campaigns for a leading Los Angeles publication. Now I jump at the chance to work for a focused startup intent on changing, well, the world. Is this the part where I say "pick me?" 

	Let's get the job done.</h3>
